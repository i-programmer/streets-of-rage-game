#Streets of rage (simple)

Streets of rage (simple) - is  a HTML5 game made with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/).

I built it to familiarize myself with HTML5 game development/phaser. I've played Streets of Rage on the SEGA Mega Drive 2 when I was a child. I love this game. That was another reason to make this mini game : )

You can play it online: [gamedev.iprogrammer.pro/streetsOfRage](http://gamedev.iprogrammer.pro/streetsOfRage/)

How do run the source code locally
----------------------------------

 - The files are all client-side, HTML and javascript.
 - Everything runs from the index.html file in the root of "game" folder
 - It must be run under a webserver (will not work in a folder on the desktop).
 - I'm using OpenServer : )
